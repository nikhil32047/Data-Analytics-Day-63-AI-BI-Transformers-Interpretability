 AI & Business Intelligence in Analytics

🔹 Lesson 1: AI-Powered Analytics
=====================================
Summary:
AI enhances analytics by automating insights, anomaly detection, and predictions.
Natural Language Queries in BI tools
Automated pattern recognition
Personalized dashboards

Example: Power BI with Copilot generates insights directly from raw data.


🔹 Lesson 2: Transformers in Analytics
=======================================
Summary:
Transformers are deep learning models originally built for NLP, now used in BI and forecasting.
Attention mechanism for feature importance
Time-series forecasting applications
Text-to-insight automation

Example: Using transformers to summarize customer feedback across millions of reviews.


🔹 Lesson 3: Model Interpretability (SHAP & LIME)
====================================================
Summary:
Transparency in models is critical. Tools like SHAP & LIME explain “why” a model predicted something.
SHAP → contribution of each feature
LIME → local model interpretability

Example: In credit scoring, SHAP shows income and repayment history drive most predictions.


🔹 Lesson 4: Ethics in AI & Analytics
==========================================
Summary:
AI must be used responsibly.
Avoid bias in data collection
Ensure fairness in model outcomes
Maintain privacy and transparency

Example: A hiring model was retrained to remove gender bias from selection outcomes.


🔹 Lesson 5: Case Study – Business Intelligence with AI
=======================================================
Summary:
Steps:
------
Connect enterprise data to BI tools
Apply transformers for NLP-based queries
Use SHAP to explain predictions
Build ethical dashboards for leadership
Example: A retail company saved $5M yearly by using AI-powered BI for inventory forecasting.
